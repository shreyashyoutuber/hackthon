// This file sets the API base used by the frontend.
// When frontend and backend are served from the same origin, leave as ''.
// If your backend has a separate URL (e.g. https://api.example.com), set it there.

// Example for local development (backend on localhost:3000):
// window.__API_BASE__ = 'http://localhost:3000';

// Example for production when backend is hosted at https://api.example.com:
// window.__API_BASE__ = 'https://api.example.com';

window.__API_BASE__ = '';
